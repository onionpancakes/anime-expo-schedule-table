Inspired by the maid cafes of Akihabara, Anime Expo’s Maid Café has been one of our most popular events. Our cute and courteous maids are ready to entertain you, whether they break out in song and dance or settle in with your table to play a game. Enjoy a drink and an interactive show, and don’t forget to thank the maids on your way out!">
