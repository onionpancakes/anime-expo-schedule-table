                    <p class="event-title" title="The Red Panda

Jordan aka The Red Panda is an EDM producer, composer, DJ, digital artist, musician, and singer. Growing up, he was raised on Gospel music and Video Games. One of his biggest inspirations was the music from Sonic The Hedgehog games, and one of the biggest being Sonic Rush. At the age of 9, he starting playing the drums for his church and had done so for the next 10 years after, but around 2011, Jordan found a new love in electronic music via Monstercat, and was inspired to start making his own music. He started producing on his phone, remixing video game tracks as well as creating original songs. It wouldn&#39;t be until 2018 that Jordan would create the stage name &#34;The Red Panda&#34; and started to truly take his craft seriously. 
Being heavily inspired by labels such as Monstercat, Tiny Waves, and Bit Bird, he set off on creating his own brand and style, and year after year was getting closer to having his own defined sound.
In 2022, he got the chance to work with German indie developer, Marcus Horn of Siactro, and composed the soundtrack for Toree 2. To this day, they still work together and are currently working on the next game Toree Saturn.">

Hi I&#39;m Dangle! I&#39;m an American singer that specializes in writing/singing English covers of popular anime opening/ending songs! While being known for English covers of popular anime songs ranging from One Piece &amp; Jujutsu Kaisen to Spy x Family &amp; Oshi no Ko, I write my translated lyrics in a way where they retain their original meaning while also being catchy enough to sing along to in English! With my versatile singing style and love for many different styles of music, I&#39;m able to match the vibe and sing in nearly every music genre! Alongside my English covers, I have also received accolades from Cartoon Network, winning second place in their Adventure Time Remix Challenge in 2021! Now I&#39;m aspiring to make another dream come true! A dream to perform my own music and covers live on stage!">

Ham Sandwich is a multi-genre rapper, singer, writer, and producer from the greater St. Louis area who primarily makes hip hop music inspired by anime, manga, and video games, filtering those topics through the lens of his own personal life experiences. Sometimes this results in ignorant trap bangers, and sometimes this results in emotional tearjerkers, but this kind of range is what has made Ham Sandwich such a rising star in the anime rap scene. Ham plans to get crowds up and moving yet again this year with a medley of tracks inspired by the best anime from the past decade.">

                    <p class="event-title" title="The Red Panda

Jordan aka The Red Panda is an EDM producer, composer, DJ, digital artist, musician, and singer. Growing up, he was raised on Gospel music and Video Games. One of his biggest inspirations was the music from Sonic The Hedgehog games, and one of the biggest being Sonic Rush. At the age of 9, he starting playing the drums for his church and had done so for the next 10 years after, but around 2011, Jordan found a new love in electronic music via Monstercat, and was inspired to start making his own music. He started producing on his phone, remixing video game tracks as well as creating original songs. It wouldn&#39;t be until 2018 that Jordan would create the stage name &#34;The Red Panda&#34; and started to truly take his craft seriously. 
Being heavily inspired by labels such as Monstercat, Tiny Waves, and Bit Bird, he set off on creating his own brand and style, and year after year was getting closer to having his own defined sound.
In 2022, he got the chance to work with German indie developer, Marcus Horn of Siactro, and composed the soundtrack for Toree 2. To this day, they still work together and are currently working on the next game Toree Saturn.">

NTXC is a hardstyle artist based on Los Angeles, CA. Started as a duo but is now a solo. Forming in 2015 with 2 artists collaborating their styles and break out of the underground scene with one vision, too really show who they are.  Coming full circle in 2019, NONTOXIC decided it was time for a mild rebrand. Converting in NTXC and dawning the Masks of a new era. With the rise of rebrand under way, the entire world shut down which made things difficult for the duo for a while like most performers. When things opened up though, they hit the ground running with major performances at festivals and clubs such as Beyond Wonderland, Wasteland, Project Z, Academy, Exchange LA, Avalon Hollywood and many more in CA and out of state. With many releases on major EDM lables like Insomniac basscon records, Electric Fox, Dirty Workz, Wolf Clan and YellowClaws Label Barong Family. As of early 2023, NTXC became a solo act but in all the best of terms. Now after a small break and setting up for the next stage of the name, NTXC is still here and ready to throw down every hard hitting aspect at you.">
