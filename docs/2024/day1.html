Starting out his journey of preforming his music /art and visuals live since last year, he has been progressing quickly and making haste of his works with alot more to come this year. With multiple self made visuals, virtual dj experiences and preforming all over the Los Angeles area looking to further his reach to a collective fan base. With an EP releasing in October and another virtual performance this summer it is something highly to take note of  made by this newly talented artist. Most of his biggest influences for music come from electro, ambient, breakbeats, heavy metal, animecore and video game sounds, he aim&#39;s to make something that truly speaks as his own world brought to life. Anime, Arcade and Retro Gaming have been a big part of his influences on art and music craft. With quick witted sampling, heavy drops or slow tempo&#39;demotional music, it&#39;s defiantly a an experience that looks to tell a story along with making you dance. A dance party you would not want to miss out on!!">

                    <p class="event-title" title="Ryukyukoku Matsuri Daiko - Los Angeles (RMDLA)

Ryukyukoku Matsuri Daiko literally translates to “Ryukyu Kingdom Festival Drums”. Ryukyu Kingdom is the ancient name for what is presently known as the Okinawa prefecture of Japan. Located just southwest of mainland Japan and northeast of Taiwan, it consists of about fifty islands, of which Okinawa is the largest. Due to its unique location, its culture and traditions have been greatly influenced not only by Japan, but also China, Korea and southeast Asia.

Ryukyukoku Matsuri Daiko is modeled on the traditional Okinawan obon festival drum dancing called “eisa”. The performers dance and drum simultaneously to an exciting blend of traditional and contemporary Okinawan and Japanese music. The group performs with several types of drums: the odaiko (big drum), which is suspended in front of the body by long pieces of purple cloth over the shoulder and back, the shime-daiko (hand-held, flat, two-sided drum), and the paranku (hand-held, flat, one-sided drum).

The Los Angeles chapter was established in 1995, and has performed at such venues as the The Grove, Nisei Week Parade, Taiko Gathering, and Coronation Ball, the Cherry Blossom Festival in Monterey Park, the U.S. Japan Expo, Los Angeles, and the L.A. County Fair.">

Anime and African American culture have had a special relationship since it first hit American shores. Everything from hip hop to fashion to Black-created film and television can see some influences from the likes of Dragon Ball, Naruto, Jojo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure, and just about every other anime under the sun. This panel brings together a wide range of Black anime superfans to talk about how the medium has influenced the culture at large and why the affinity is so strong and the love so deep. ***This room will NOT be cleared prior to this panel.

Juliana Chahayed is a 27-year-old singer and songwriter based in Los Angeles. With over a social following over 1 million – followers sometimes call her “phone girl,” owing to her signature use of a telephone mic – Juliana has made waves with lo-fi jazz-tinged covers ranging from Radiohead’s “No Surprises” to “Fly Me to the Moon” to favorites from anime and cartoons. Her most recent EP, August’s “Phone Mic Girl,” racked up almost 2 million Spotify plays in just a month. Born to a musical family – her brother is Grammy-nominated super-producer Rogét Chahayed, and her younger sister is indie pop singer-songwriter Andrea Chahayed – Julie began singing at age 7, and had a brief run on American Idol when she was just 15, at the time the youngest contestant ever on the show">

                    <p class="event-title" title="Lucrecia

Lucrecia began in 2016 when singer/screamer Suki Nox expressed an interest in forming a band with fellow screamer Frankie Alonzo after both attended a gig together. Frankie, whose band at the time was quickly coming to a close, agreed with little to no hesitation. Suki and Frankie quickly went to work and came up with the name which comes from the Final Fantasy VII character “Lucrecia”. Suki and Frankie decided that the band in itself is an ode to everything they love from otaku (a person who greatly enjoys Japanese games, anime, and films) culture. The band found success with the song &#34;Brotherhood&#34;, which was featured on the popular Youtube channel &#39;Dreambound&#39;. Since then Lucrecia has gone on to develop quite a dedicated fan base from releasing songs like &#34;Sleeping Slaves Of Fate&#34;, which pushed over 300k views on youtube. The video showcased the band&#39;s love for anime and kawaii, while also proving that their music can stand out in the metalcore genre.">

Boy Hero is here to save you from mundane Post-Hardcore. Soaring melodies, visceral breakdowns, and emotive storytelling are just some of the elements that make up his sound. Drawing from his midwest roots, he harnesses the spirit of the Minneapolis emo scene and combines it with the sounds and feelings inspired by the most beloved anime properties. “One cannot gain anything without first giving something in return” - which is why Boy Hero leaves everything on the stage and in his song writing. Boy Hero will always be there reaching out with his music for those in need of hope to hold on to.">

Crossing the Pacific Ocean and infusing island culture into hiphop music, Rocco808 is the next stage that Island pop has been cultivating over the last few years. After making the transition from a small island to the big city of Los Angeles, he honed his craft and developed his own sound after years of experimental projects of writing, recording, and composing records. He goes above and beyond, exceeding expectations creating island pop melodies on trap drums and other various productions. His combination of such diverse sounds expresses his authenticity and his reinvention of pop reggae, Afro and rap music.">
