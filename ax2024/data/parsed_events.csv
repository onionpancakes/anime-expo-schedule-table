With multiple self made visuals, virtual dj experiences and preforming all over the Los Angeles area looking to further his reach to a collective fan base.

Ryukyukoku Matsuri Daiko literally translates to ‚ÄúRyukyu Kingdom Festival Drums‚Äù. Ryukyu Kingdom is the ancient name for what is presently known as the Okinawa prefecture of Japan. Located just southwest of mainland Japan and northeast of Taiwan, it consists of about fifty islands, of which Okinawa is the largest. Due to its unique location, its culture and traditions have been greatly influenced not only by Japan, but also China, Korea and southeast Asia.

Ryukyukoku Matsuri Daiko is modeled on the traditional Okinawan obon festival drum dancing called ‚Äúeisa‚Äù. The performers dance and drum simultaneously to an exciting blend of traditional and contemporary Okinawan and Japanese music. The group performs with several types of drums: the odaiko (big drum), which is suspended in front of the body by long pieces of purple cloth over the shoulder and back, the shime-daiko (hand-held, flat, two-sided drum), and the paranku (hand-held, flat, one-sided drum).

The Los Angeles chapter was established in 1995, and has performed at such venues as the The Grove, Nisei Week Parade, Taiko Gathering, and Coronation Ball, the Cherry Blossom Festival in Monterey Park, the U.S. Japan Expo, Los Angeles, and the L.A. County Fair.",False

New York-based pop vocalist turned rockstar Saki Rose is a solo vocalist on the forefront of a western visual kei revival. Their 5 octave range, powerful belt, distinctively pop vocal stylings, and technical prowess have stunned rock and metalcore audiences around the world. In an era where visual kei, the Japanese musical subculture, is considered a dying art, Saki's mission is to revitalize the genre, its distinctive aesthetics, and its defiance of gender norms, appealing to both fresh and seasoned audiences. Despite the niche status of the genre, they've amassed millions of views on YouTube by covering numerous visual kei classics. They have been hailed by JRock News as a rising talent in the scene. Saki Rose is bringing visual kei and J-rock classics to the Anime Expo stage from artists such as DIR EN GREY, the GazettE, HYDE, and hide. Backed by Felix Skiver, Sky Citizen, Riffs, and Kid Yuki, they're ready to rock their first solo stage. Are you ready for the visual kei revolution?",False

Ryukyukoku Matsuri Daiko literally translates to ‚ÄúRyukyu Kingdom Festival Drums‚Äù. Ryukyu Kingdom is the ancient name for what is presently known as the Okinawa prefecture of Japan. Located just southwest of mainland Japan and northeast of Taiwan, it consists of about fifty islands, of which Okinawa is the largest. Due to its unique location, its culture and traditions have been greatly influenced not only by Japan, but also China, Korea and southeast Asia.

Ryukyukoku Matsuri Daiko is modeled on the traditional Okinawan obon festival drum dancing called ‚Äúeisa‚Äù. The performers dance and drum simultaneously to an exciting blend of traditional and contemporary Okinawan and Japanese music. The group performs with several types of drums: the odaiko (big drum), which is suspended in front of the body by long pieces of purple cloth over the shoulder and back, the shime-daiko (hand-held, flat, two-sided drum), and the paranku (hand-held, flat, one-sided drum).

The Los Angeles chapter was established in 1995, and has performed at such venues as the The Grove, Nisei Week Parade, Taiko Gathering, and Coronation Ball, the Cherry Blossom Festival in Monterey Park, the U.S. Japan Expo, Los Angeles, and the L.A. County Fair.",False
